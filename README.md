## MMM-BMW-DS

**Bugger My Weather** DarkSky

## Same church, different pew

I wanted to take a new approach at a weather module. Until now, I had only done WWI and WWI2 but I
wasn't really happy with those, although they were fun to do. This has a bit more style to it (not much)
and it doesn't resemble other modules in format or appearance. I learned a couple of new things while
doing it and I used what I learned in the module itself. Nothing monumental but very satisfying for me.

* Minutely updates for current conditions
